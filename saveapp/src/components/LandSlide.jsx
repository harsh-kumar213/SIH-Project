The slow motion of the Indian crust, about 5 cm/year accumulates stress to which natural disasters are attributed. Some landslides make unique, and unparalleled catastrophes. Landslides and avalanches are among the major hydro-geological hazards that affect large parts of India besides the Himalayas, the Northeastern hill ranges, the Western Ghats, the Nilgiris, the Eastern Ghats and the Vindhyans, in that order, covering about 15 % of the landmass. The Himalayas alone count for landslides of every fame, name and description- big and small, quick and creeping, ancient and new. The Northeastern region is badly affected by landslide problems of a bewildering variety. Landslides in the Darjeeling district of West Bengal as also those in Sikkim, Mizoram, Tripura, Meghalaya, Assam, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh pose chronic problems, causing recurring economic losses worth billions of rupees. A different variety of landslides, characterized by a lateritic cap, pose constant threat to the Western Ghats in the South, along the steep slopes overlooking the Konkan coast besides Nilgiris, which is highly landslide prone.</p>


<p>Some spectacular events of tragedies are reported as Varnavat landslide, Uttarkashi District, Malpha landslide Pithoragarh district, Okhimath landslide in Chamoli district, UK and Paglajhora in Darjeeling district as well as Sikkim, Aizawl sports complex, Mizoram.These are some of the more recent examples of landslides. The problem therefore needs to be tackled for mitigation and management for which hazard zones have to be identified and specific slides to be stabilized and managed in addition to monitoring and early warning systems to be placed at selected sites.</p>

National Remote Sensing Center (NRSC),Department of Science and Technology (DST), Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Indian Institute of India (IITs), Universities have done tremendous work in this regard. The NRSC Atlas on selected corridors of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh has been a very useful Atlas (Please see NRSC work on Landslides). DST has funded more than 30 projects spread over India by various academic institutions the reports of which can be requested from DST (NRDMA).</p>

<p>An example of LHZ map at 1: 50,000 scale from a part of Himalayas in Chamoli district (Pachauri, 1992) shown here is based upon several geological, geotechnical parameters. Such maps are being refined and relooked for higher level of verification and acceptability for public use. Approximately 15 % of the Indian landmass has to be covered by such maps at 1: 50,000 scale or higher to classify slopes in various levels of hazards. Geographical Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing applications are being used through NRSC under a special group of GIS for LHZ at NDMA through database collection from all concerned departments and being stored through good offices of GIS and other agencies, CSIR labs, DST etc as a parallel theme on landslide mitigation.</p>

The Government of India has made plans to identify the areas where landslides occur repeatedly. This is achieved through Landslide Hazard Zonation (LHZ) maps which shows or demarcates areas by different colors. NDMA has published a guideline on Landslides and Snow Avalanches as given on its website. Following are the precautionary measures for landslides in the form of do's and dont's as given below:</p>

<p><strong>Do's </strong></p>

<ul><li>Prepare tour to hilly region according to information given by weather department or news channel.</li>
	<li>Move away from landslide path or downstream valleys quickly without wasting time.</li>
	<li>Keep drains clean,</li>
	<li>Inspect drains for - litter, leaves, plastic bags, rubble etc.</li>
	<li>Keep the weep holes open.</li>
	<li>Grow more trees that can hold the soil through roots,</li>
	<li>Identify areas of rock fall and subsidence of buildings, cracks that indicate landslides and move to safer areas. Even muddy river waters indicate landslides upstream.</li>
	<li>Notice such signals and contact the nearest Tehsil or District Head Quarters.</li>
	<li>Ensure that toe of slope is not cut, remains protected, don't uproot trees unless re-vegetation is planned.</li>
	<li>Listen for unusual sounds such as trees cracking or boulders knocking together.</li>
	<li>Stay alert, awake and active (3A's) during the impact or probability of impact.</li>
	<li>Locate and go to shelters,</li>
	<li>Try to stay with your family and companions.</li>
	<li>Check for injured and trapped persons.</li>
	<li>Mark path of tracking so that you can't be lost in middle of the forest.</li>
	<li>Know how to give signs or how to communicate during emergency time to flying helicopters and rescue team.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Don'ts</strong></p>

<ul><li>Try to avoid construction and staying in vulnerable areas.</li>
	<li>Do not panic and loose energy by crying.</li>
	<li>Do not touch or walk over loose material and electrical wiring or pole.</li>
	<li>Do not built houses near steep slopes and near drainage path.</li>
	<li>Do not drink contaminated water directly from rivers, springs, wells but rain water if collected directly without is fine.</li>
	<li>Do not move an injured person without rendering first aid unless the casualty is in immediate danger.</li>
